   <h2>History</h2>
 <p>Phil Knight, one of the two founders of Nike, <br>
     founded "Blue Ribbon Sports" in 1964, <br>
      which received the franchise to market the sports shoes of the Japanese company Onitsuka. <br>
       His founding partner was Bill Bowerman,
        <br> Knight's running coach at the University of Oregon. In the first year of operation,
         <br> the company sold 1,300 pairs of shoes and brought in about $8,000,
         <br> most of the sales were made out of the trunk of Nate's car.
         <br> In 1965 the company hired one full-time employee and the company's sales rose to $20,000.
         <br> In 1966, the company opened its first store in Santa Monica, California.
         br  In 1969, sales reached a decent volume and Knight resigned from his position
         <br> as a lecturer at the University of Oregon and devoted himself to his work at the company full time.</p>
         <h2>The Logo Swoosh</h2>
         <p>
            The famous Nike logo was created in 1971 by Carolyn Davidson,
            <br> a graphic design student at the University of Portland. <br> Phil Knight, the founder of Nike,
            <br> met her when he was an accounting lecturer and hired her to do freelance work for his shoe company.
            <br>When Knight decided to create a new brand for his sneakers,
            <br> he approached Davidson and asked her to design several ideas. 
            <br> She agreed, for a wage of two dollars an hour. 
           <br> In June 1971, Davidson presented several design options to Knight and other company executives,
           <br> and the symbol known as the "Swoosh" was selected.
           <br> Davidson submitted an invoice for $35 for her work.
           <br> In 1983, as a gesture of gratitude, Knight gave Davidson a diamond ring with the symbol on it, as well as Nike shares.

          <h2>More..</h2>
          <p>Contrary to popular opinion, 
           <br> the shape of the swoosh is not based on the famous statue of Nika
           <br> the Victorious (in the Louvre Museum).
           <br> The logo was designed a few months before the name Nike was adopted in August 1971 as the brand's new name.
           <br> The symbol was initially called simply "the strip" and only after some time received its familiar name.</p>
